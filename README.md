# ECAVI-release-v2

ECAVI (Event Calculus Analysis and VIsualisation) is a domain-independent modelling tool, which offers a visual language for designing dynamic domains in the Event Calculus, while assisting the user in the process of knowledge engineering, through the ADOxx meta-modelling platform and with the help of a state-of-the-art automated reasoner, Clingo.
